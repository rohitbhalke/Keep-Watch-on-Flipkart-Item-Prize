# Keep-Watch-on-Flipkart-Item-Prize
Flipkart big billion day. Price of lots of products on this site is getting up and down. I want to grab the product before it goes to out of stock. But how? Manual checking is too annoying. So simple solution is here. :)   
  This python script is used to keep an eye on any flipkart's item prize. As we visit flipkart to buy something and finally end up by saying the cost is too much. So you want to grab the product as soon as prize gets lower :). Run this script, it will let you know as soon as prize goes down.

You can change the way it alerts you. I used to play my favourite song from youtube, You can change it.
