# Keep-Watch-on-Flipkart-Item-Prize
Actually I missed a product on Flipkart's Big Billion Day. So I decided, next time Flipkart decides to go for another Big Billion Day, I would not miss my chance and hence, I decided to write a script for the same. So, what exactly is this script? We all often go to Flipkart to buy a certain product but end up not going for it as its not within our budget. On days like Big Billion Day, lot of discount offers start floating all around and if there is a particular product we wish to buy, that too, at a favourable price, we would be glad not to miss it. The script I have written will help in this purpose. It will run continuously and keep an eye on the certain product the user is interested in and it will notify the user by playing a song if the price of the product has come down from the original amount. I know there are lot of other scripts that have already been written for this, but still I would like to share what I have come up with :)
